full debugger implementation for ruby.
Work in progress, check github page:
https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-ruby-debug-ide

basics are working and remaining stuff can be implemented easily, progress see README.
breakpoints, stepping, restarting, var view

based on vim-addon-async (async communication without blocking vim)

With nox patch (client-server without X) this can be used on servers to debug ruby code, see docs of vim-addon-async.
